# Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Continuous Monitoring Demo

## üéØ Overview
This document demonstrates the enhanced VAD implementation that provides py-xiaozhi-like continuous microphone monitoring during AI voice playback, enabling immediate conversation interruption.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **Continuous Monitoring**
- **Speaking State**: Monitors for user voice to interrupt AI response immediately
- **Idle State**: Monitors for user voice to auto-start listening (when KeepListening enabled)
- **State-Aware Processing**: Different energy thresholds and speech windows based on device state

### 2. **Enhanced VAD Parameters**
```csharp
// Speaking state (interruption mode)
private const double EnergyThreshold = 300.0;           // Lower threshold for quick response
private const int SpeechWindow = 5;                     // 5 frames for fast interruption

// Idle state (activation mode)  
private const double IdleStateEnergyThreshold = 500.0;  // Higher threshold to avoid false positives
private const int IdleStateSpeechWindow = 8;            // 8 frames for more stable activation
```

### 3. **State-Specific Behaviors**
- **During AI Speaking**: Immediate voice chat interruption via `StopVoiceChatAsync()`
- **During Idle**: Auto-start listening via `StartVoiceChatAsync()` when KeepListening enabled
- **Automatic State Management**: Resets VAD state when transitioning between monitored states

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Console Application Test
1. **Build and Run Console App**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\github\xiaozhi-dotnet
   dotnet run --project XiaoZhi.Console
   ```

2. **Enable Auto Dialogue Mode** (Option 4):
   - This enables `KeepListening = true`
   - Activates idle state voice detection for auto-start

3. **Test Interruption During AI Response**:
   - Start voice chat (Option 1)
   - Wait for AI to respond and start speaking
   - Speak during AI response - should immediately interrupt

4. **Test Auto-Activation from Idle**:
   - With KeepListening enabled, wait in idle state
   - Speak - should auto-start listening mode

### WinUI Application Test
The VAD service is also integrated into the WinUI application through dependency injection.

## üîß Integration Points

### 1. **Service Registration**
```csharp
// Both Console and WinUI apps register VAD through InterruptManager
services.AddSingleton<IVoiceChatService, VoiceChatService>();
// InterruptManager automatically creates VADDetectorService
```

### 2. **InterruptManager Control**
```csharp
// Enable/disable VAD
interruptManager.SetVADEnabled(true);

// Pause/resume during user input
interruptManager.PauseVAD();
interruptManager.ResumeVAD();
```

### 3. **Event Handling**
```csharp
// VAD events are coordinated through InterruptManager
vadDetector.VoiceInterruptDetected += OnVADInterrupt;
```

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Audio Processing
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz, 16-bit mono
- **Frame Duration**: 20ms (320 samples per frame)
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous analysis with minimal latency

### State Transitions
- **Speaking ‚Üí Idle**: VAD continues monitoring for auto-restart
- **Idle ‚Üí Speaking**: VAD provides quick activation response
- **Non-monitored States**: VAD resets and pauses processing

## üîç Technical Implementation

### Key Components
1. **VADDetectorService**: Core VAD implementation with continuous monitoring
2. **InterruptManager**: Coordinates VAD with other interrupt sources
3. **VoiceChatService**: Integrates VAD events with voice chat lifecycle

### Python py-xiaozhi Compatibility
- **Energy-based Detection**: Similar RMS energy calculation
- **Frame-based Processing**: 20ms frame analysis matching Python implementation
- **State-aware Thresholds**: Adaptive parameters based on device state
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Always-on detection during Speaking and Idle states

## üéâ Result
The C# XiaoZhi project now provides py-xiaozhi-like continuous microphone monitoring that enables immediate conversation interruption during AI voice playback, fully addressing the original user requirement.

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. **Real-world Testing**: Test with actual voice conversations
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on testing feedback
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor CPU usage during continuous monitoring
4. **Additional Features**: Consider adding noise gate or more sophisticated VAD algorithms
